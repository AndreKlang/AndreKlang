For quite some time it's been possible to set the color theme in Chrome for Android to match your sites main color. However, it's not been widely adopted until a month or two ago, when I stared to see matching theme in my chrome, and kind of liked it.

So I hit my friend Google with the question,, and it wasn't that easy to find actually, a lot of nonsense results. Until I found the source:Â <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2014/11/Support-for-theme-color-in-Chrome-39-for-Android" target="_blank">Original post from Google</a>

So it turns out it's very easy to set the theme, just include a meta-tag with the HEX of your color, like this:

{% highlight html %}
<meta name="theme-color" content="#db5945">
{% endhighlight %}

(I'll add a pretty screenshot later..)

<strong>Update:</strong>

I found additional info as well regarding <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/design-and-ui/browser-customization/theme-color" target="_blank">the similar thing in Apples Safari</a>
